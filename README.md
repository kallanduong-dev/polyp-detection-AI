# Detector Training
The google colab notebook I used for training and detections I used is found in the YOLOv3ModelTraining.ipynb file. The notebook contains instructions on how to set up to train and run detections. The config file and weights that I trained are also in the Github.
# Graph Generation
The code I used to generate the graphs from previously run detections are found in the graphs.py file.
#Privacy
The use and access of the SUN database requires permissions. The images and annotations have not been included in this repository. After getting permission add the image annotations into the annotation_txt folder to run the code.
